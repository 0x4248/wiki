# PMR446

**PMR446** (Private Mobile Radio 446) is a license-free radio frequency band in the UHF spectrum. It is intended for short-distance, two-way communication using handheld radios. PMR446 is available in most European countries and a few other countries worldwide.

## Frequency range

PMR446 operates in the `446.00625-446.19375 MHz` frequency range. The band is divided into 8 channels, each with a 12.5 kHz channel spacing.

- **Channel 1**: `446.00625 MHz`
- **Channel 2**: `446.01875 MHz`
- **Channel 3**: `446.03125 MHz`
- **Channel 4**: `446.04375 MHz`
- **Channel 5**: `446.05625 MHz`
- **Channel 6**: `446.06875 MHz`
- **Channel 7**: `446.08125 MHz`
- **Channel 8**: `446.09375 MHz`

### Extra channels

Some PMR446 radios support additional channels outside the standard 8 channels. These radios may have up to 16 or more channels, including the standard 8 channels. For example some Motorola radios have 16 channels, with the additional channels being:

- **Channel 9**: `446.10625 MHz`
- **Channel 10**: `446.11875 MHz`
- **Channel 11**: `446.13125 MHz`
- **Channel 12**: `446.14375 MHz`
- **Channel 13**: `446.15625 MHz`
- **Channel 14**: `446.16875 MHz`
- **Channel 15**: `446.18125 MHz`
- **Channel 16**: `446.19375 MHz`

## Laws and regulations

PMR446 radios are license-free in most European countries. However, there are some restrictions on the use of PMR446 radios.

### Maximum power transmission

PMR446 radios are limited to a maximum power output of `500 mW (0.5 W)`. This power limit ensures that PMR446 radios have a short communication range, typically up to a few kilometers in open areas. This distance can be shorter in urban areas with buildings and other obstructions.

### Detachable antennas

PMR446 radios **must have fixed antennas**. Detachable antennas are not allowed on PMR446 radios. This restriction is in place to prevent users from attaching high-gain antennas that can increase the radio's range and interfere with other users.

### Interference

PMR446 radios must not cause interference to other radio services. Users should avoid transmitting on PMR446 channels if they hear other users on the same channel. If interference occurs, users should switch to a different channel or wait until the channel is clear.

## Usage

PMR446 radios are commonly used for short-distance communication in various scenarios, including:

- **Outdoor activities**: Hiking, camping, cycling, and other outdoor adventures.
- **Events and festivals**: Coordination among event staff, security, and volunteers.
- **Business and retail**: Communication within small businesses, warehouses, and retail stores.
- **Family communication**: Keeping in touch during outings, shopping trips, or family vacations.
